# This is the informaion gathering technique using OS like kali linux:

- Within LAN,
  - NetDiscover. Usage: `netdiscover -r <IP_address>`
- Out of LAN,
  - curl
  - whatweb
  - dnsenum
  - dnsrecon
  - fierce
  - lbd
  - maltego
- dnsenum / dnsrecon:
  - Gives more details about the target, and also used to do zone transfer attack
- fierce:
  - This tool runs more tests against target to retrieve more details
- LBD:
  - LBD -> Load Balancer Detector
  - Used to detect whether the load balancer is being used or not
  - If they use any load balancer, assume they have bigger infrastructure and have firewall
- Maltego:
  - This is a well known OSINT tool, can be able to gather almost all information about the target in one place
  - The output is like tree like structure so we can get a better view at what relates to what
- With mobile,
  - Using **Fing** app installed in playstore
