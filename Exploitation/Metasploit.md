# What is Metasploit?

The commonly used cli based Metasploit is known as **Metasploit Framework (msfconsole).** This framework is built for storing all known exploits compiled and ready to run to make easier the work for penetration testers.

### Terms we used in msf:

- **exploit** - This is exploit which is used to exploit the system
- **payload** - Setting up a series of work after the exploit is done in a system like make reverse shell immediately after exploitation
- **meterpreter** - It is also known as **advanced payload** which it stores all the commands. It is very useful when we don't know what command should we use in victim system in order to make a work. For eg, I want to take a screenshot of the victim's system, but i don't know what command should I use, then I make use of this meterpreter
- **auxillary** - All the modules listed as auxillary is for scanning purpose and not for exploitation
- **msfvenom** - It is a combination of `msfpaylad + msfencode`. in simple terms, it is used for creating or generating a virus file

#### Naming convention

1. If we saw a payload named `ms08_67_NETAPI`, we should understand it like,  
   | ms | 08 | 67 | NETAPI |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | microsoft related | exposed on year 2008 | 67th number or just a fancy like in CVE numbers | exploit using which technology |
