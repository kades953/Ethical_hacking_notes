# SQL Injection

It is a method of exploitation in SQL based servers when they are misconfigured.

### Steps is this attack:

- Identifying injection points - the points where the url is weak like parameter or something
- Generating errors - give any random input like numbers, alphabets, symbols, special characters and so on to generate any type of SQL error
- Analyzing errors - after generated one, analyze that, how the SQL server is configured
- Finding user input encapsulation - it is nothing but the developers write code to accept the input in certain form like the input in single quotes, double quotes, or anything ( 'input', "input", ('input'), ("input") )
- To balance the query/error - after finds out, balance that like ' OR 1=1'`<space>`--
- To inject sql codes - in that space, we can give the sql codes like,
  - Order by (to find how many columns are there)
  - union select (to find which column is weak)

### Comments in SQL

- \--
- \#
- /\* anything you want to give \*/
- \+ (to give space)

### Tools can be used

- sqlmap
