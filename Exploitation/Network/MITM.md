# What is MITM?

MITM stands for the 'Man in the middle', It is attack that works only in same LAN where the users and attacker should be.

### What tool should I use?

arpspoof,

- First we change a file in `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` from 0 to 1. Because we need to enable IP forwarding
- The MITM attack only work when the IP forwarding is done
- Open 2 terminal,
  - Terminal 1, `arpspoof -i <which connection such as eth0> -t <victim IP> <router IP>`
  - Terminal 2, `arpspoof -i <which connection such as eth0> -t <router IP> <victim IP>`
- Open wireshark tool to listen what the victim is doing

### What all the supporting tools?

- driftnet - to capture all the photos victim visited
- ettercap - alternative gui based tool to arpspoof
