# Path Traversal

### What is Path Traversal?

Path traversal is also known as directory traversal. These vulnerabilities enable an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that is running an application. This might include:

- Application code and data.
- Credentials for back-end systems.
- Sensitive operating system files.

In some cases, an attacker might be able to write to arbitrary files on the server, allowing them to modify application data or behavior, and ultimately take full control of the server.

### Reading arbitrary files via path traversal

If you find any url like this, `https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=example.png`, this will lead to this vulnerability.  
By editing the url like, `https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=../../../etc/passwd`.
The `../../../` will works on both windows and linux, If it doesn't works on windows, just try this `..\..\..\`

### Common obstacles to exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities

- If the application strips or blocks the directory traversal, just type the absolute path from file system root like, `filename=/etc/passwd`
- Also try nested traversal like, `....//` or `....\/`
- If the filename parameter is sanitized, you can encode and send it like, `%2e%2e%2f` or `%252e%252e%252f` or `..%c0%af` or `..%ef%bc%8f`
- An application may require the user-supplied filename to start with the expected base folder, such as `/var/www/images`, in case like this, use this, `filename=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd`
- An application may require the user-supplied filename to end with an expected file extension, such as `.png`. In that case, use this `filename=../../../etc/passwd%00.png` this `%00` will eliminate the extension

## How to prevent a path traversal attack

The most effective way to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities is to avoid passing user-supplied input to filesystem APIs altogether.  
If you can't avoid passing user-supplied input to filesystem APIs, use two layers of defense to prevent attacks:

- Validate the user input before processing it. Ideally, compare the user input with a whitelist of permitted values. If that isn't possible, verify that the input contains only permitted content, such as alphanumeric characters only.
- After validating the supplied input, append the input to the base directory and use a platform filesystem API to canonicalize the path. Verify that the canonicalized path starts with the expected base directory.

Below is an example of some simple Java code to validate the canonical path of a file based on user input:

```
File file = new File(BASE_DIRECTORY, userInput);
if (file.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(BASE_DIRECTORY)) {
    // process file
}
```
