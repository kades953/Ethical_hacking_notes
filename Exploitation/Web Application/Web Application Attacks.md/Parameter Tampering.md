# What is Parameter tampering?

This is nothing but the modification that we made to the packets leads to gain some unauthenticated access from website.

## How to do that?

1. Turn on BurpSuite, But not intercept,
2. Go to the page in website that we need to modify,
3. Turn on Intercept and capture the packet,
4. Right click and select **do intercept > requests from browser**
5. Change something that related to which you are like tamper, response code, errors, and so on,
6. Click **Forward**.
