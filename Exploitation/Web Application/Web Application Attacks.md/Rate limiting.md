# What is Rate limitting?

Rate limitting is used for limitting the requests from a single or same IP address. It prevents brute forcing, dos/ddos, account takeover, and so on.

## To Verify whether the Rate limit is set or not in a website:

1. In BurpSuite, intercept the packet of anything like login page or register page or something that will gives the response,
2. Send the packets to Intruder,
3. Add the injection points to the `q=^0.5^` in `Accept-language` line,
4. Select numbers in payload options, from 0, to 100 or something, step 1,
5. Send,
6. If the response is coming for all the requests, then there is no **rate limiting** is set.

> The Response code for this rate limit is `429`
